FitNesse Maven Examples
=======================

I had some difficulty finding out how to integrate [FitNesse][1] with
[Maven][2], so I created this project to document my successes.  In
particular, I found a few Maven plugins that would handle the
integration of FitNesse, but I stumbled over older versions on newer
ones, which plugin does what, etc.  At the end of the day, I've found
the [Trinidad][3] plugin is the best overall choice.

Having picked the /winner/, I tried to integrate it with a bare-bones
FItNesse installation, but had some difficult with that as well.  In
this code is a very simplistic model of FitNesse integration with Maven.
